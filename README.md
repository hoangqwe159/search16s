# search16s
The program facilitates access to the 16S sequences file, supporting various search functionality, supporting several complexity levels as described below:
1. Sequential access using a starting position in the file. 
2. Sequential access to a specific sequence by sequence-id.
3. Sequential access to find a set of sequence-ids given in a query file, and writing the output to a specified result file.
4. Indexed file access, implementing direct access to sequences.
5. Search for an exact match of a DNA query string. 
6. Search for a sequence meta-data containing a given word
7. Search for a sequence containing wild cards.
